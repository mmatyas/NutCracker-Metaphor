# Metaphor NutCracker - Squirrel Decompiler
This program roughly decompiles Squirrel .cnut files. 
There are a few issues, but almost all scripts should decompile. 
I don't plan on maintaining this, but wanted to toss this up for anyone interested. 
If you are making simple changes, it might be worth working in 010Editor using the MetaphorCNut.bt template -- this worked for me to bypass the demo time limit.... :)

# Notes
Squirrel version is likely 3.2
Based on work from Darknesswind, DamianXVI, and other contributors to the original repo

# Usage 
nutcracker.exe script.cnut > script.nut
